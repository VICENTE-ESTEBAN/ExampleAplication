 # Mobile Test

We would like to propose you a little challenge. Are you ready?

We are going to make an application that shows a list of movies, showing the most characteristic information of each one and, if the user decides to click on one of them, we will show him more detailed information.

This test should take between 4-6 hours but, don't worry, the question is not the time but the quality of your code, so you will be able to submit your exercise during the next 7 days.

## Requirements: 
- You can get the data from an online service like OMDB or TheMovieDatabase.
- The main view should show a list of movies with the following content for each of them:
    > Poster
    > Title
    > Release year
- The detailed view should show more information about the selected movie:
    > Title
    > Director
    > Poster
    > Release year
    > Duration
    > Description
    > Score

- Navigate from main view to detailed view
 
## Extra
  - Try to add Dark/Light mode support.
  - Search by name
  - Filter by year
  - Remove movies from the list
## What are we going to evaluate?
- Definition of an architecture for the app from scratch.
- Creativity to solve the requirements.
- Quality of the code delivered (structure and good practices).
- Efficiency of the delivered solution.
- Familiarity with libraries, frameworks and development platforms.
- Git flow knowledge
## Notes
- Tests are desirable.
- We value clean code & domain-oriented architectures.
- Try to make the implementation as close as possible to the design.
- Includes external libraries.
- It is recommended to add an file.md in the provided. solution to explain by text what is considered appropriate.
- Let us know how to run your solution and its tests.
- We need the versions of:
    - Supported Android Platforms
    - Android SDK
    - JDK
    - Kotlin
    - Gradle
- Please submit your solution and any notes as a zip file and rename the file with your full name.
